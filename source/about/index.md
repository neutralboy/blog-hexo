# Hi, I'm Poorna

Hey I'm Poornachandra, a medical student from Bangalore. I use this blog to write on all the resources I hope I had found while I was programming. 
These blogs are not based on any specific topics. All of Cloud Computing, Devops, Analytics, Django and everything under the sun.

Coding is more of a hobby to me, I find it calming.
Have any questions ? [Ask me](mailto:hey@poorna.dev)
